# RM-variable-selection-nonconvex

This repository contains code for robust and missing-data-aware variable selection with nonconvex penalties in high-dimensional regression, as described in our paper.

## File overview

-1. helper_funcs and synthetic .R:
In this R file, we have the helper funcs and the synthetic dataset implementation code

-2. Real datasets example code.R:
This is the example code of 2 real datasets

## Getting started

- Requires R (>= 4.0) and the following packages: `ncvreg`, `glmnet`, `robustbase`, `data.table`, `ggplot2`, etc.
